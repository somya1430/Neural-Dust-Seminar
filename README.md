## Abstract

Neural Dust (The future of brain-computer communication) represents a transformative leap in brain-machine interface technology by enabling wireless, minimally invasive sensing and stimulation of neural and muscular activity. Comprised of millimeter- to micrometer-scale, ultrasound-powered sensor nodes, Neural Dust can be implanted in the body to continuously monitor electrical signals from nerves, muscles, or brain tissue without tethered leads or bulky hardware. This seminar explores the underlying principles of Neural Dust—its architecture, the use of ultrasonic backscatter for power and communication, and the bioelectronic materials that enable scalable deployment. Key applications, including prosthetic control, real-time neural monitoring for neurological disorders, and closed-loop therapeutic interventions, are discussed to highlight its potential impact on medicine and human augmentation. The current state of research, primarily demonstrated in animal models, reveals both promising results and significant technical challenges such as reliable wireless power delivery, long-term biocompatibility, signal fidelity, and data interpretation. Ethical and societal implications, including privacy of neural data and future human-machine integration, are also examined. The seminar concludes with a forward-looking perspective on how Neural Dust could evolve into seamless brain-computer communication systems and catalyze a new class of neuroadaptive technologies.
